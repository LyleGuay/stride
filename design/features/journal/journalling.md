User can write daily journals. 

AI :
Prompting you during your daily writing. Like "you've mentioned sleep schedule three times this month, have you actually tried anything different?" That's useful friction.
Pulling out patterns over longer periods — quarterly or yearly. "Here are the themes that kept coming up." At that timescale you'd genuinely miss things on your own.
Searching your journal conversationally. "When did I last feel really good about work?" That's where Obsidian + AI could shine.
