Journal would allow the user to enter text regarding how they're day is going, their thoughts, feelings, ideas, etc...

The day journal view would be a timeline with multiple entries. The user can:
- Create an entry
- Update an exsting entry.

Each entry has a time and an optional "tagging". the tags on an entry can include:
- Emotions: Mad, Happy, Sad, Depressed (with corresponding icon).
- Type Tag: Life Update, Thoughts, Feelings, Venting, Idea, Reminder, Openloops.

The idea is to allow user more control over how they journal and to represent the journal as a "braindump" of sorts.

The user would be able to search for specific entries as well by tag/favoriting.

Using the tagging, we can provide stats on how the user was feeling throughout the week or month. How theyir emotional state changes over time and analyze possible causes.
