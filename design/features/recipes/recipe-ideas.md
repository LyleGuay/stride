User can create recipes with assistance of AI. The goal is to make creating and executing recipes very easy and avoid anxiety around these.

User can add:
- Notes: Important notes before starting.
- Ingredients. With name, quantity/quantity UOM and optional note.
- Tools needed for the recipe -- spoons, oven, etc...
- Instructions. Each instruction would be a a paragraph of text. Each instruction can reference ingredients/tools previously defined.
- Delays can be defined between steps for waiting. A timer can also have a corresponding text. A timer can have 2 modes: pre-step or post-step. Depending on when the timing should be done.
- (Nice to have): Would be nice to have "continue" steps (lack of better term) where a step can happen during a timer -- for steps that should happen while your waiting on something else.

User can enter "Execution Mode":
- Marking steps as done
- Starting timers
- Keep phone on.

- Recipes can be used to aid in logging calories. There would be an option when logging calories to choose from a recipe and choose servings (calories and macros would be proportional to entered serving)
